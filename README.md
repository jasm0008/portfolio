# portfolio


<!-- Producing my portfolio has shown me how thrilling and nerve-wracking making websites and coding can be. 
As in situations where you are instructed to recreate something but only have a visual illustration.
The hardest part is turning it into a code, which requires a lot of patience and can lead to an axiomatic mentality. 
The easiest way I've found to do it is to take each step individually, concentrating on a page at a time.
If there are any bugs or issues, I should leave them alone and concentrate on the other pages before returning to what needs to be fixed. -->
